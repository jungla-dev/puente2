  This proposal revolves around the circle, the pieces that make up the capsule
  are represented and how the capsule itself does not exist without the objects
  / life stories that form it; each letter represents an object that is related
  and interrelated with its space. The letters / objects do not touch <ins>but
  intimately form a group, a community; in turn, each letter generates its own
  code and when put together</ins> they reveal the name of the capsule as a
  mystery that exists and lives in the same space.
